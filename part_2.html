On the inside, alphys, Napstablook Frisk and Chara are gatherd in a circle, conversing in the living room. Napstablook and Chara are floating, whilst the others are sitting on stools.
        </p>
        <li>Alphys: "S-so these d-reams just k-keep happening?"</li>
        <li>Chara: "Yeah...it's really weird."</li>
        <li>Chara: "The strangest thing is that I can remember everything in them. It's not like how dreams are supposed to be."</li>
        <li>Napstablook: "I thought teaching you to sleep as a ghost would help. I guess it just caused problems. sorry..." </li>
        <li>Chara: "No, no! It's just fine.  I love being able to sleep now after being forced awake for all those months after connecting to Frisk."</li>

        <li>Frisk: <i>A confused look</i> "A toy knife like the one I found?"</li>
        <li>Chara: "Yeah! Like that one. Anyways, she was running from this...feral looking spider monster thing. And then she tripped. After that...well, the spider killed her. It...wasn't nice to look at.</li>
